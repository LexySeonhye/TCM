# Draft Notes On Implimenting The TCM
Now that the Morpheus community has proven the Techno Capital Machine model and the network is in the boot strapping phase its worth exploring how to extend the TCM to other projects building on Morpheus to leverage the same building blocks of fair launch, yield contribution, and on chain tracking of rewards.

- 1. Leveraging the MOR tokens as the practical means of implimenting the Techno Capital Machine model.

- 2. Reuse the same Smart Contracts, just this time instead of providing stETH, users stake MOR tokens.

- 3. The Morpheus protocol can provide a "yield" for MOR staking for example by leveraging 8% of the MOR tokens out of the Community Builder Reward.

- 4. MOR holders then direct this MOR staking yield to developers who propose / build a specific a Smart Agent.

- 5. The Smart Agent goes through a bootstrapping period and when delivered those who staked toward that specific Smart Agent end up receiving a part of the MOR rewards it produces from fees on the network.

- 6. This approach brings the capital provision function into the MOR tokenomics.

- 7. Just like the most popular thing to do in Ethereum early on was to use ETH to provide resources for open source projects building on Ethereum.

- 8. Except in this case the approach can skip right to the maturity of a staking mechanism and having all the records of supporters on chain avoids central points of failure.

- 9. Capital Providers gain another utility for their MOR toekns. Namely supporting more open source projects being developed on Morpheus.

- 10. MOR token holders get to keep their original MOR tokens and the yield goes to the open source project they want to support.

## Conclusion:
This type of framework can be fully implimented after the Capital, Code, and Compute asepcts are fully deployed as part of phase 3 of the Community Builder deployment. By offering the TCM to a broad set of developers the Morpheus community can extend the incentives it has proven in order to reward smart agent devs building on Morpheus. Devs will be able to gain support seamlessly and deploy their code having done nothing more then copy and pasted the TCM Dashboard interface and used the Morpheus Smart Contracts (well audited and secure) and tapped into its passionate community. This approach removes so much friction and takes many risks off the table for everyone involved.
