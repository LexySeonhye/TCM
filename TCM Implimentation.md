# Draft Notes On Implimenting The TCM

- 1. Leveraging the MOR tokens as the practical means of implimenting the Techno Capital Machine model.

- 2. Reuse the same Smart Contracts, just this time instead of providing stETH, users stake MOR tokens.

- 3. The Morpheus protocol can provide a "yield" for MOR staking for example by leveraging 8% of the MOR tokens out of the Community Builder Reward.

- 4. MOR holders then direct this MOR staking yield to developers who propose / build a specific a Smart Agent.

- 5. The Smart Agent goes through a bootstrapping period and when delivered those who staked toward that specific Smart Agent end up receiving a part of the MOR rewards it produces from fees on the network.

- 6. This approach brings the capital provision function into the MOR tokenomics.

- 7. Just like the most popular thing to do in Ethereum early on was to use ETH to provide resources for open source projects building on Ethereum.

- 8. Except in this case the approach can skip right to the maturity of a staking mechanism and having all the records of supporters on chain avoids central points of failure.

- 9. Capital Providers gain another utility for their MOR toekns. Namely supporting more open source projects being developed on Morpheus.

- 10. MOR token holders get to keep their original MOR tokens and the yield goes to the open source project they want to support.
